//Outer Class
//A nested class is a class defined within another class. For example, let’s say in the app of the Little Lemon restaurant you have a class Order. This class can have a nested class DeliveryDetails to store information such as a delivery address, delivery fee and so forth.
//Note: In this example, Order is the outer class.

class Order
{
val orderId = 1  
class DeliveryDetails
{
val deliveryFeeInDollars = 10  
}
}
println(Order.DeliveryDetails().deliveryFeeInDollars).  
// This prints 10 

//Inner Class
 //let’s say for the outer class Order that contains a constructor parameter orderAmount there can be an inner class TaxDetails that calculates the amount of tax for the given order amount of the outer class.

class Order(val orderAmount: Int)
{   
inner class TaxDetails 
{    
val taxAmount = 0.05 * orderAmount     
}  
} 
// Create instance of Order with amount 100 val order = Order(100)       
// Create instance of TaxDetails using the instance of Order class  val taxDetails = order.TaxDetails()  
// Print the tax amount equal to 5 println(taxDetails.taxAmount)
